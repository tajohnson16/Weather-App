# Weather-App
## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to become more familiar with React Native and Expo
by creating a minimalist weather app. The app uses the Open Weather API to collect
weather information and displays this information dynamically, changing the background
color and weather condition icon based on the weather. I used Expo to develop and
test the application on my iPhone, which allows me to do so without XCode.
